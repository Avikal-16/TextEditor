# TextEditor
A basic text editor created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple digital tool that allows users to input and manipulate text. The user interface consists of a resizable text input area and a few buttons for essential actions. 

The HTML structure forms the foundation, while CSS styling makes the editor visually appealing. 

JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling functions like saving, opening, and formatting text. Though minimal, this basic text editor demonstrates the core principles of creating an interactive application on the web.
